# LeagueVoice
This python application allows you to communicate with your team in League of Legends without having to open the chat all the time! 

## Infos
This is a fork of the english LeagueSpeak script by [MilesJuddPorter](https://github.com/MilesJuddPorter/leagueSpeak)
This version translates german input into english output.

## How to use
Press Y to start a recording, press Y again to stop it. (Currently 4 seconds is the limit, set it higher in the code for a longer recording)
